# News Site

News Site is a web application built with React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to browse and read news articles from various categories. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and responsive platform for users to stay informed about the latest news across different topics.

## Key Features

- **News Categories**: News Site offers a variety of categories, such as US News, Sports, Politics, Health, Entertainment, Science, Climate, and Technology. Users can select their preferred category to read relevant news articles.

- **Sorting Options**: Users can sort news articles based on different criteria, including published date, relevance, and popularity. The sorting option allows users to customize their news feed based on their preferences.

- **Pagination**: To improve the browsing experience, News Site implements pagination, displaying a limited number of articles per page. Users can navigate through different pages to access a large volume of news articles.

- **Persistent Preferences**: The application uses local storage to persist user preferences, such as the selected category, sub-category, and sorting option. Users can refresh the page or return to the website at a later time to find their preferences intact.
